Gameplay



Step 1:

Open the file "run.bat".  If a warning pops up, select "run" or "open anyway".



Step 2:

You will be prompted to enter your name, do so and press ENTER.



Step 3:

Type your desired amount of rounds (in digits) and press ENTER. This can be any odd number greater than zero.



Step 4:

Perform your throw by typing in the sign’s corresponding digit and pressing ENTER.



Step 5:

Continue entering throws until the game ends.  





Game Rules

* Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Nothing special here.

* The game cannot be played with an even amount of rounds.

* The game continues until one player wins a "best of" for the amount of rounds entered (excluding ties).

* The winner of the game is displayed once the game is finished.  





Notes 

* You can exit the game at any time by pressing CTRL-C and then Y.

* The game starts from Step 1 upon finishing a game.

* You can only play against the computer, which throws out a random move for each turn.

* A simplified version of this readme file is included in the download.  




Troubleshooting   

* If the batch file fails to execute, you may need to update your java installation.

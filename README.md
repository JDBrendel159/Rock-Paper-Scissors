# Rules
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Nothing special here.

The game cannot be played with an even amount of rounds.

The game continues until one player wins a "best of" for the amount of rounds entered (excluding ties).
The winner of the game is displayed once the game is finished.

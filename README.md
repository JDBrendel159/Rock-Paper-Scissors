# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Welcome to my simple Rock, Paper, & Scissors game

The repository page can be found <a href="https://github.com/JDBrendel159/Rock-Paper-Scissors">here.</a>

The Github webpage can be found <a href="http://jdbrendel159.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/">here.</a>

## Features
* Name your player whatever you want
* Play as many games as you want with any amount of rounds
* A large variety of strategies to choose from
* Ties do not count towards round total
  
  
## Installation

The game can be downloaded as a ZIP using <a href="https://github.com/JDBrendel159/Rock-Paper-Scissors/archive/master.zip">this link.</a>

Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice, and open "run.bat" to begin the game.
  
  
## Usage

#### Step 1:

Open the file "run.bat".  If a warning pops up, select "run" or "open anyway".

#### Step 2:

You will be prompted to enter your name, do so and press ENTER.
```java
Enter player name: Troy //sets player name to Troy
```

#### Step 3:

Type your desired amount of rounds (in digits) and press ENTER. This can be any odd number greater than zero.
```java
Enter player name: Troy //sets player name to Troy
How many rounds would you like to play?: 1 //This will tell the game to play a best of 1 round
```
#### Step  4:

Perform your throw by typing in the signâ€™s corresponding digit and pressing ENTER.
```java
Enter player name: Troy //sets player name to Troy
How many rounds would you like to play?: 1 //This will set the game to 1 round

Enter your throw (0=Rock, 1=Paper, 2=Scissors): 1 //I have thrown paper against the computer
Troy throws PAPER
The Computer throws ROCK
Troy wins!

Troy: 1
Computer: 0
```
#### Step 5:

Continue entering throws until the game ends.
  
## Game Rules
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Nothing special here.

The game cannot be played with an even amount of rounds.

The game continues until one player wins a "best of" for the amount of rounds entered (excluding ties).
The winner of the game is displayed once the game is finished.
  
  
## Notes
* You can exit the game at any time by pressing CTRL-C and then Y.
* The game starts from Step 1 upon finishing a game.
* You can only play against the computer, which throws out a random move for each turn.
* This readme file is included in the download.
  
  
## Troubleshooting
Extracting the ZIP file requires either <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org">7Zip.</a>

If the batch file fails to execute, you may need to update your java installation.  The most recent Java version can be found <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download">here.</a>

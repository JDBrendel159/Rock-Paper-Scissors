# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The implementation involves creating three files.  One file contains the client code and the other two files are the classes (Player & Game).

The design for the Classes should be (you may need to add helper methods):

Class Player
  Variables:  playerName, playerThrow
  Methods:
     makeThrow – prompts player for throw
     getThrow – returns the player’s throw.

Class Game
  Variables: compThrow, playerWins, playerThrow

Methods:
  makeCompThrow – generates computer’s throw.
  getCompThrow – returns the computer’s throw.
  announceWinner – displays messages for throws & winner (requires parameters for player throw and player name.
  bigWinner – determine overall winner

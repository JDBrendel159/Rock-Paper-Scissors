# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Welcome to my simple Rock, Paper, & Scissors game

This readme contains some basic information about the RPS program.  More documentation can be found <a href="https://jdbrendel159.github.io/RPSDocumentation/">here.</a>

# Rules
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Nothing special here.

The game cannot be played with an even amount of rounds.

The game continues until one player wins a "best of" for the amount of rounds entered (excluding ties).
The winner of the game is displayed once the game is finished.

# Download/Installation
The game can be downloaded as a ZIP using <a href="https://github.com/JDBrendel159/Rock-Paper-Scissors/archive/master.zip">this link.</a>

Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice, and open "run.bat" to begin the game.

# Playing the Game
Currently the game can only be played against the computer, which throws out a random move every turn.

When the game opens, you will be prompted to enter your name, do so and press ENTER.

It will then prompt you to enter an amount of rounds, this can be any number.
Type your desired amount of rounds (in digits) and press ENTER.

Throws are performed by typing in the sign's corresponding digit and pressing ENTER.

You can exit the game by pressing CTRL-C and then Y.

# Troubleshooting
Extracting the ZIP file requires either <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org">7Zip.</a>

If the batch file fails to execute, you may need to update your java installation.  Java downloads can be found <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download">here.</a>

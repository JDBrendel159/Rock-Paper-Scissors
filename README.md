# Rules
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Nothing special here.

The game continues until the amount of rounds input has been played (excluding ties).
The winner of the game is the player with the most rounds won at the end.

It is possible to tie the game if an even amount of rounds is input.
